It is impossible to generate a solution that meets the budget. This is because the budget is smaller than the cost of managing each site under the cheapest management available action. In other words, even if each site was managed under the cheapest available management action, the overall cost of these actions is still larger than the specified budget. If the specified budget is reasonable, then you might need to consider creating a new project dataset that considers additional management actions, such as a baseline "do nothing" action wherein no conservation activities are implemented (with a cost of zero).
