It is impossible to generate a solution that meets all of the goals. This error can happen when a goal -- or multiple goals -- are too high, such that no combination of management actions can possibly be implemented to reach the goals. If you have specified that certain management actions cannot be implemented in certain sites (per the “Feasibility” data), this error can also happen if certain management actions are needed for certain sites in order to reach the goals. To address this error, please try lowering the goals to identify which goal (or combination of goals) are too high. If you think that the goals are reasonable, then this error could suggest the data vastly underestimate the expected amount of certain features given certain management actions - so these data might need to be adjusted.
